- ✅ config.php - EXISTS
- ✅ firestore_admin_service.php - EXISTS
- ✅ brevo_email_service.php - EXISTS

**Files checked during cleanup:**

- ❌ Deleted invoice HTML templates - Not used (PDFs generated via FPDF) ✅

**Conclusion:** Our previous cleanup did NOT break any API dependencies!

## 🎯 KEY RECOMMENDATIONS

### IMMEDIATE ACTION (Security):
```bash
❌ DELETE: api/config.php.backup
```
**Reason:** Contains sensitive credentials, security risk!

### SAFE TO DELETE (10 files):
All test files, duplicate PDF generators, duplicate affiliate files.
**See:** `API_CLEANUP_ACTION_LIST.md` for exact commands

### REVIEW NEEDED (6 files):
Need to verify which version is in use before deleting.
**See:** Detailed analysis in main report
