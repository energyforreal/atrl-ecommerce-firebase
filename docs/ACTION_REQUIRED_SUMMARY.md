# üö® ACTION REQUIRED: Upload Config to Production Server

## The Issue (Simple Explanation)

Your payment system is failing with **"Authentication failed (401)"** because:

1. ‚úÖ **Frontend (browser)** has Razorpay key: `rzp_live_RKD5kwFAOZ05UD`
2. ‚ùå **Backend (server)** doesn't have credentials yet
3. üîê The server needs the **secret key** to create payment orders

**Think of it like:** Your website knows your Razorpay "username" but not the "password"

---

## What Was Created

I've created the missing configuration file with your credentials:

```
üìÑ static-site/api/config.php
   Contains:
   - RAZORPAY_KEY_ID: rzp_live_RKD5kwFAOZ05UD
   - RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET: msl2Tx9q0DhOz11jTBkVSEQz
   - RAZORPAY_WEBHOOK_SECRET: Rakeshmurali@10
```

**This file is currently on YOUR COMPUTER ONLY** ‚ö†Ô∏è

## Testing Checklist

After uploading:

- [ ] Visit: `https://attral.in/api/test_config.php`
- [ ] Should see: `"status": "‚úÖ SUCCESS"`
- [ ] Should see: `"has_razorpay_key_id": true`
- [ ] Should see: `"has_razorpay_key_secret": true`
- [ ] Should see: `"api_test_result": { "http_code": 200 }`

Then test payment:

## What the Console Should Show (After Fix)

**BEFORE (Current - BROKEN):**
```
üîß Order Creation Response: { status: 401, responseOk: false }
‚ùå Order creation failed: Authentication failed
```

**AFTER (After Upload - WORKING):**
```
üîß Order Creation Response: { status: 200, responseOk: true }
‚úÖ Order created successfully!
‚úÖ Razorpay modal opens
```

---

## Where to Upload

**Server Path (Most Common):**
```
/home/youruser/public_html/static-site/api/config.php
```

**Alternative Paths:**
```
/public_html/static-site/api/config.php
/htdocs/static-site/api/config.php
/www/static-site/api/config.php
```

**How to Find Your Path:**
1. Login to Hostinger/cPanel
2. Open File Manager
3. Navigate to where `create_order.php` already exists
4. Upload `config.php` in the same folder

---

## Verification Steps

### Step 1: Verify Upload
```
https://attral.in/api/test_config.php
```
**Look for:**
```json
{
  "config_file_exists": true,
  "config_loaded": true,
  "status": "‚úÖ SUCCESS"
}
```

### Step 2: Test Order Creation
```
https://attral.in/api/create_order.php
```
**Test with this payload:**
```json
{
  "amount": 10000,
  "currency": "INR",
  "receipt": "test_123"
}
```

**Should return:**
```json
{
  "id": "order_xxxxx",
  "amount": 10000,
  "status": "created"
}
```

### Step 3: Test Full Payment Flow
1. Open: `http://localhost:8000/order.html?type=cart`
2. Add product to cart
3. Go to checkout
4. Click "Pay with Razorpay"
5. Razorpay modal should open!

---

## Security Checklist (After Testing)

- [ ] Delete `test_config.php` from server
- [ ] Add `config.php` to `.gitignore`
- [ ] Set file permissions: `chmod 600 config.php`
- [ ] Never commit credentials to Git
- [ ] Remove debug logging from `create_order.php`

---

## Troubleshooting

### ‚ùì "Config file doesn't exist"
**Fix:** Upload to correct path - check file manager

### ‚ùì "Config loaded: NO"  
**Fix:** Check PHP syntax - file should start with `<?php`

### ‚ùì Still getting 401
**Fix:** Verify credentials in Razorpay dashboard

### ‚ùì "File permissions denied"
**Fix:** `chmod 644 config.php` via SSH or file manager

---

## Quick Commands

**View file location:**
```powershell
explorer.exe static-site\api
```

**Copy file path:**
```powershell
(Get-Item 'static-site\api\config.php').FullName | Set-Clipboard
```

**Test after upload:**
```
https://attral.in/api/test_config.php
```
