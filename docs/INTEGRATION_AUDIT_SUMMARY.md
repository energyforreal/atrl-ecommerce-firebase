## ✅ Fixes Implemented

### 1. Firestore Security Rules ✅

**Created**: `firestore.rules`

**Features**:
- User-level access control for orders and addresses
- Public read for products and coupons
- Admin-only write access for sensitive collections
- Server-only writes via Admin SDK for critical operations

**Impact**: Database is now secure against unauthorized access.

**Deployment Required**: Yes - run `firebase deploy --only firestore:rules`

### 2. Firestore Composite Indexes ✅

**Created**: `firestore.indexes.json`

**Indexes Added**:
- Orders: `uid + createdAt`, `status + createdAt`, `uid + status + createdAt`
- Products: `featured + price`, `category + price`, `status + createdAt`
- Affiliates: `code + createdAt`, `affiliateCode + createdAt`
- Addresses: `uid + isDefault`, `uid + createdAt` (plus userId variants)

**Impact**: Queries will run fast without "missing index" errors.

**Deployment Required**: Yes - run `firebase deploy --only firestore:indexes`

### 3. Environment Variable Configuration ✅

**Modified**: `static-site/api/config.php`  
**Created**: `ENV_VARIABLES_README.md`, `firebase.json`

**Changes**:
- Removed all hardcoded credentials
- Added `getEnvVar()` helper function
- Safe fallbacks for development
- Clear documentation for production setup

**Impact**: Credentials no longer exposed in version control.

**Action Required**: Set environment variables in production (see ENV_VARIABLES_README.md)

### 4. Duplicate Order Creation Prevention ✅

**Modified**: `static-site/order.html`

**Changes**:
- Removed client-side Firestore writes
- Orders now created exclusively by webhook and server-side API
- Added clear documentation of new flow
- Prevents race conditions

**Impact**: No more duplicate orders in database.

**Testing Required**: Verify single order creation in production.

### 5. Enforced Payment Verification ✅

**Modified**: `static-site/order.html`

**Changes**:
- Payment verification failure now STOPS order creation
- Failed verifications logged to localStorage for review
- Added comprehensive error messages
- Prevents processing invalid payments

**Impact**: Prevents fraudulent or tampered payment attempts.

**Testing Required**: Test with invalid signature to ensure rejection.

### 6. Standardized Currency Conversion ✅

**Modified**: `static-site/api/create_order.php`

**Changes**:
- Clear documentation: amounts must be in paise
- Added range validation (₹1 to ₹1,000,000)
- Logs suspicious amounts
- Consistent handling throughout

**Impact**: Eliminates currency conversion errors.

**Backward Compatible**: Yes

### 7. Server-Side Price Validation ✅

**Modified**: `static-site/api/create_order.php`

**Changes**:
- Validates pricing calculation (subtotal + shipping - discount = total)
- Verifies Razorpay amount matches calculated total
- Validates shipping costs (0 or 399)
- Detects and logs manipulation attempts

**Impact**: Prevents users from manipulating prices.

**Testing Required**: Try modifying prices in browser - should be rejected.

### 8. CORS Restrictions & Rate Limiting ✅

**Created**: `static-site/api/cors_helper.php`  
**Modified**: `create_order.php`, `verify.php`, `webhook.php`

**Features**:
- Origin validation against ALLOWED_ORIGINS
- Localhost support for development
- Rate limiting per IP (configurable per endpoint)
- Webhook detection (bypasses origin check)
- Detailed logging of violations

**Impact**: Prevents CSRF attacks and API abuse.

**Configuration Required**: Set ALLOWED_ORIGINS environment variable.

### 9. Firebase Configuration File ✅

**Created**: `firebase.json`

**Features**:
- Firestore rules and indexes deployment config
- Hosting configuration (optional)
- Functions configuration (prepared for future)

**Impact**: Enables proper Firebase deployments.

**Usage**: `firebase deploy --only firestore`

## 📝 Issues Documented (Not Yet Fixed)

These issues are documented but not critical enough for immediate fix:

### 1. Firebase Cloud Functions Missing
- **Status**: PHP replacement (`affiliate_functions.php`) is working
- **Recommendation**: Either deploy Functions or update README to remove references
- **Priority**: Low

### 2. Inconsistent UID Field Usage
- **Status**: Both `uid` and `userId` fields work due to composite indexes
- **Recommendation**: Standardize to `uid` in future refactor
- **Priority**: Low

### 3. Coupon Usage Idempotency
- **Status**: Works with existing retry logic and payment ID checks
- **Recommendation**: Add Firestore transactions for atomic increments
- **Priority**: Medium

### 4. Affiliate Commission Tracking
- **Status**: Old system commented out, coupon tracking is active
- **Recommendation**: Clean up commented code, document final approach
- **Priority**: Low

### 5. Firebase Health Check Timeout
- **Status**: Works fine in normal conditions
- **Recommendation**: Add 5-second timeout to prevent rare blocking issues
- **Priority**: Low

### 6. Order Status Standardization
- **Status**: Multiple status values work but inconsistent
- **Recommendation**: Define and document standard status flow
- **Priority**: Medium

### 7. Webhook Secret Configuration
- **Status**: Must be set as environment variable
- **Recommendation**: Document in README, create setup script
- **Priority**: High (deployment requirement)

### 8. Email Verification
- **Status**: Not implemented
- **Recommendation**: Add email verification before first order
- **Priority**: Low
