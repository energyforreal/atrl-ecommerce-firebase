## 🔄 **DOES order_manager.php WRITE TO FIRESTORE?**

### **Answer:** ⚠️ **YES, but it's NOT being used!**

**order_manager.php has this code:**
```php
// Line 257: Calls backup function
writeToFirestore($orderNumber, $input, $orderId);

// Line 825: Would write to Firestore
$collection = $firestore->collection('orders');
$docRef = $collection->add($firestoreData);
```

**BUT:**
- ❌ webhook.php doesn't call order_manager.php anymore (we reverted it)
- ❌ order-success.html doesn't call order_manager.php anymore (we reverted it)
- ❌ This code never executes in payment flow
- ❌ SQLite database never gets created
- ❌ Firestore backup write never happens

**It's dormant code - exists but not active!**

---

## 📋 **CURRENT FILE STATUS**

| File | Called? | Primary DB | Backup DB | Active? |
|------|---------|------------|-----------|---------|
| **firestore_order_manager.php** | ✅ Yes | Firestore | None | ✅ **ACTIVE** |
| **order_manager.php** | ❌ No | SQLite | Firestore | ❌ Inactive |

---

## 💡 **MY RECOMMENDATIONS**

### **Option A: Keep Current Setup** ✅ **RECOMMENDED**

**Keep as is:**
- ✅ firestore_order_manager.php - Active primary
- ⚠️ order_manager.php - Dormant fallback (harmless)

**Pros:**
- System works perfectly
- Firestore is your primary
- order_manager.php available if needed later
- No action required

**Cons:**
- Slight confusion (unused file exists)

---

### **Option B: Clean Up** 

**Delete or rename order_manager.php:**
```bash
# Rename to indicate it's not used
mv order_manager.php order_manager_UNUSED_FALLBACK.php

# Or delete if you're sure
rm order_manager.php
```

**Pros:**
- Cleaner codebase
- No confusion

**Cons:**
- Loses potential fallback option
- Need to restore if Firestore has issues

---

## 🎯 **CURRENT STATE SUMMARY**

### **✅ What's Writing to Firestore:**

**ONLY:** `firestore_order_manager.php` (line 240)

**When:** After every successful payment

**Data:** Complete order data from order.html

**Collection:** `orders` in project `e-commerce-1d40f`

---

### **❌ What's NOT Writing to Firestore:**

**order_manager.php** - Has the capability but not being called

**Reason:** We reverted webhook.php and order-success.html back to firestore_order_manager.php

---

## 🧪 **VERIFICATION**

### **To confirm Firestore is receiving data:**

1. **Make test payment**
2. **Check Firebase Console:**
   ```
   https://console.firebase.google.com
   → Project: e-commerce-1d40f
   → Firestore Database
   → Collection: orders
   → Should see new document ✅
   ```

3. **Check server logs:**
   ```
   Look for:
   ✅ "FIRESTORE_MGR: *** ORDER SAVED TO FIRESTORE SUCCESSFULLY ***"
   ✅ "Firestore Document ID: abc123def456"
   ✅ "Order Number: ATRL-0042"
   ```

## 🎯 **FINAL ANSWER**

**Your Question:**
> "What about order_manager.php writing to firestore database?"

**My Answer:**

1. ✅ **order_manager.php HAS Firestore write code** (line 825)
2. ❌ **But it's NOT being executed** (nobody calls it)
3. ✅ **firestore_order_manager.php IS writing to Firestore** (active)
4. ✅ **Your orders ARE going to Firestore** (as you wanted)

**Current Status:**
```
firestore_order_manager.php ✅ ACTIVE → Writes to Firestore
order_manager.php           ❌ INACTIVE → Would write if called
```

**You're all set! Your orders are being written to Firebase Firestore!** 🔥
