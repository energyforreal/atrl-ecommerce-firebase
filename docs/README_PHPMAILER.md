## 🔧 What Was Fixed

### The Only Issue
Your standalone PHP installation was missing required extensions:
- ❌ `openssl` - for SMTP TLS encryption
- ❌ `curl` - for HTTP requests
- ❌ `mbstring` - for email encoding

### The Solution
Use XAMPP PHP which has all extensions enabled:
```
C:\xampp\php\php.exe
```

### Result
✅ All extensions now available
✅ Email sending tested successfully
✅ Test email delivered to info@attral.in
