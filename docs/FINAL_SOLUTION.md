# 🎉 FINAL SOLUTION - Everything is Working!

## ✅ Problem Solved!

**Issue:** Your standalone PHP installation was missing critical extensions (openssl, curl, mbstring).

**Solution:** Use XAMPP's PHP instead, which has all extensions enabled!

## 🎯 Current Status

| Component | Status | Details |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| **Firebase Service Account** | ✅ **WORKING** | File added and validated |
| **SMTP Email Configuration** | ✅ **WORKING** | Brevo credentials configured |
| **PHP Extensions** | ✅ **WORKING** | Using XAMPP PHP (all extensions available) |
| **Email Sending** | ✅ **WORKING** | Test email sent successfully! |
| **Firestore Integration** | ✅ **READY** | Service account configured |

## 🔧 How to Use Your Fixed System

### For Development/Testing:

**Use XAMPP PHP for all commands:**
```powershell
# Instead of: php script.php
# Use this:
C:\xampp\php\php.exe script.php

# Examples:
C:\xampp\php\php.exe validate-firebase-setup.php
C:\xampp\php\php.exe test-email-sending.php
```

### For Your Website:

**Option 1: Use XAMPP Web Server (Recommended)**
1. **Start XAMPP Control Panel**
2. **Start Apache** 
3. **Copy your project to:** `C:\xampp\htdocs\ecommerce\`
4. **Access your site at:** `http://localhost/ecommerce/`

- All your API files will work with full functionality
