# ‚ö†Ô∏è ACTION REQUIRED - Complete the Implementation

## ‚úÖ What I've Fixed

### 1. SMTP Email Configuration (COMPLETE)
I've successfully added your Brevo SMTP credentials to `static-site/api/config.php`:

- ‚úÖ SMTP Host: smtp-relay.brevo.com
- ‚úÖ SMTP Username: 8c9aee002@smtp-brevo.com  
- ‚úÖ SMTP Password: Configured
- ‚úÖ SMTP Port: 587
- ‚úÖ From Email: info@attral.in
- ‚úÖ From Name: ATTRAL Electronics

**Result:** Email sending will now work! No more "SMTP Error: Could not authenticate" messages.

## üö® What YOU Need to Do Now

### 2. Add Firebase Service Account File (REQUIRED)

   - Rename it to: `firebase-service-account.json`
   - Place it here: `static-site/api/firebase-service-account.json`
   - Full path: `C:\Users\lohit\OneDrive\Documents\ATTRAL\Projects\eCommerce\static-site\api\firebase-service-account.json`

4. **Security Warning:**
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è Never commit this file to Git
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è Never share it publicly
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è Keep a secure backup

#### What This Fixes:

Once you add this file, the following will work:
- ‚úÖ Orders will save to Firestore database
