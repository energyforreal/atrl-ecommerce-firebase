## 🔍 Debugging Checklist

If something still doesn't work, check these logs in order:

### Step 1: Order Creation
Check browser console for:
- ✅ Coupon data logged with `isAffiliateCoupon: true`
- ✅ Order payload logged before sending

Check server logs for:
- ✅ `FIRESTORE ORDER: Processing X coupons...`
- ✅ `COUPON SERVICE: Affiliate coupon detected...`
- ✅ `COUPON SERVICE: ✅ Atomically incremented...`

### Step 2: Affiliate Profile Lookup
Check server logs for:
- ✅ `AFFILIATE STATS: Querying stats for code=...`
- ✅ `AFFILIATE STATS: ✅ Found affiliate profile...`

If you see `❌ Affiliate not found`:
- Verify affiliate exists in Firebase Console: `affiliates` collection
- Verify field name is `code` (not `affiliateCode`)
- Check affiliate code matches exactly (case-sensitive)

### Step 3: Order Queries
Check server logs for:
- ✅ `AFFILIATE ORDERS: Processed X total orders, found Y matching orders`
- ✅ `AFFILIATE ORDERS: Matched order IDs: ...`

If matched count is 0:
- Check if orders have `coupons` array
- Check if `coupons[].code` matches affiliate code
- Check if orders have `status: "confirmed"`

### Step 4: Frontend Display
Check browser console for:
- ✅ API responses logged with data
- ✅ Parsed values logged

If stats show ₹0:
- Check API response in console
- Verify `totalEarnings` is in response
- Check for JavaScript parsing errors

## 📖 Documentation

### Firestore Schema (Confirmed)

**Affiliates Collection**:
```javascript
affiliates/{uid}: {
  code: "partea-abc123",         // ← Field name is 'code'
  email: "user@example.com",
  displayName: "John Doe",
  status: "active",
  createdAt: Timestamp
}
```

**Coupons Collection**:
```javascript
coupons/{docId}: {
  code: "partea-abc123",         // ← Same as affiliate code
  name: "Affiliate Discount",
  type: "percentage",
  value: 5,
  isActive: true,
  isAffiliateCoupon: true,
  affiliateCode: "partea-abc123",
  usageCount: 1,                 // ← Increments by 1
  payoutUsage: 300,              // ← ₹300 per order for affiliates
  updatedAt: Timestamp
}
```

**Orders Collection**:
```javascript
orders/{docId}: {
  orderId: "ORD-20241008-001",
  status: "confirmed",
  amount: 2999,
  coupons: [                     // ← ARRAY of coupon objects
    {
      code: "partea-abc123",
      name: "Affiliate Discount",
      type: "percentage",
      value: 5,
      isAffiliateCoupon: true,
      affiliateCode: "partea-abc123"
    }
  ],
  customer: {...},
  pricing: {...},
  createdAt: Timestamp
}
```

## 🎓 Key Technical Notes

### Why Manual Filtering?
Firestore **does not support** querying array fields directly:
```php
// ❌ NOT POSSIBLE in Firestore:
->where('coupons.code', '=', $affiliateCode)

// ✅ REQUIRED approach:
->where('status', '=', 'confirmed')  // Get all confirmed orders
// Then loop and check if coupons array contains the code
```

### Performance Considerations
- Current implementation queries up to 100 orders (configurable)
- Filters client-side, so actual results may be less
- For high-volume stores (1000+ orders), consider:
  - Add denormalized `affiliateCodes[]` field to orders
  - Create Firestore index on this array field
  - Would allow direct queries

### Commission Calculation
- **Fixed amount**: ₹300 per order (not percentage)
- Stored in `payoutUsage` field
- Increments atomically using Firestore `FieldValue::increment()`

---

## 🎉 Expected Behavior After Fixes

### Affiliate Dashboard
- Shows correct total earnings (₹300 per order)
- Lists all referred orders
- Updates in real-time
- No more "Affiliate not found" errors

### Admin Panel
- Shows usage: "X uses (₹Y earned)"
- Auto-refreshes every 30 seconds
- Displays all affiliate coupons with stats

### Coupon Tracking
- Increments on payment confirmation only
- Idempotent (no duplicates)
- Logs to subcollection for audit trail

## 📞 Support

If you encounter any issues:
1. Check browser console for frontend errors
2. Check server logs for backend errors
3. Verify Firestore data in Firebase Console
4. Share relevant logs for diagnosis

All logging prefixes:
- `[ORDER]` - Frontend order page
- `[AFFILIATE STATS]` - Stats API/frontend
- `[AFFILIATE ORDERS]` - Orders API/frontend
- `[COUPON ADMIN]` - Admin panel
- `COUPON SERVICE` - Backend tracking
- `FIRESTORE ORDER` - Order creation

---

## ✨ Success Metrics

Track these to verify system is working:

1. **Coupon Usage Count** (`usageCount` in Firestore)
   - Should increment by 1 per order
   
2. **Commission Tracking** (`payoutUsage` in Firestore)
   - Should increment by 300 per affiliate order
   - Shows as "₹300 earned" in admin panel

3. **Affiliate Dashboard**
   - Total Earnings = usageCount × 300
   - Referred Orders list populated
   
4. **Admin Panel**
   - Stats update automatically
   - Shows commission amounts for affiliate coupons
