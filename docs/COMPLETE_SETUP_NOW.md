# üöÄ Complete Setup in 3 Steps

## What You Provided vs What We Need

### ‚úÖ What You Provided (Client-Side Config):
```javascript
const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "AIzaSyCMzmyqQ-WJuYrK0dNsTqljlDsCkmOIXOk",
  authDomain: "e-commerce-1d40f.firebaseapp.com",
  projectId: "e-commerce-1d40f",
  // ... etc
};
```
**This is already in use** in your frontend JavaScript files. ‚úÖ No action needed here.

### ‚ùå What We Still Need (Server-Side Service Account):
A **different JSON file** that looks like this:
```json
{
  "type": "service_account",
  "project_id": "e-commerce-1d40f",
  "private_key_id": "abc123...",
  "private_key": "-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\n...",
  "client_email": "firebase-adminsdk-xxxxx@e-commerce-1d40f.iam.gserviceaccount.com"
}
```
**This is for server-side PHP** to save orders to Firestore database.

## ‚ö° Why This File is Different

| Client Config (what you provided) | Service Account (what we need) |
|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| For JavaScript/Frontend | For PHP/Backend |
| Used in browser | Used on server |
| Public (safe to commit) | Private (secret!) |
| Allows user auth, read data | Allows admin operations |
| Already configured ‚úÖ | Missing - need to add ‚ùå |

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### "Permission denied" when generating key
- You need **Owner** or **Editor** role in Firebase project
- Check with project owner to grant you access

### "File not found" after moving
- Double-check the file path
- Make sure it's named exactly: `firebase-service-account.json`
- No extra spaces or characters

### "Invalid JSON" error
- Re-download the file from Firebase Console
- Don't edit the file manually
- Make sure it wasn't corrupted during download

### Still getting empty `{}` from coupon upsert
- File is in wrong location
- File is corrupted/invalid
- Run `php validate-firebase-setup.php` to diagnose
