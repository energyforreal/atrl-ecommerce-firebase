## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### **App can't connect to website:**
1. ✅ Ensure your local web server is running at `localhost:3000`
2. ✅ Check that base URL in config is `http://10.0.2.2:3000`
3. ✅ Check Windows Firewall isn't blocking port 3000

### **Emulator is slow:**
- Enable virtualization in BIOS (Intel VT-x or AMD-V)
- Close other heavy applications
- Increase RAM in AVD settings (Android Studio → Device Manager → Edit AVD)

### **Build errors:**
```powershell
# Clean build
flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter run
```
