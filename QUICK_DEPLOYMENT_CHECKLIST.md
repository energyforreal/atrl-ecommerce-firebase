## 📋 PRE-DEPLOYMENT CHECKLIST

- [x] ✅ All code implemented
- [x] ✅ Zero linter errors
- [x] ✅ All functions tested locally
- [ ] ⏳ Files uploaded to Hostinger
- [ ] ⏳ Cache directory created
- [ ] ⏳ Live payment test completed
- [ ] ⏳ Customer email received

---

## 🎯 DEPLOYMENT STEPS (15 Minutes)

### **Step 1: Upload Files** (5 minutes)

Via Hostinger File Manager or FTP:

```
Upload to /public_html/:
└── order.html

Upload to /public_html/api/:
├── firestore_order_manager_rest.php
├── validate_coupon.php
├── check_order_status.php
└── get_my_orders.php
```

### **Step 2: Create Cache Directory** (1 minute)

Via Hostinger File Manager:
```
Create folder: /public_html/api/.cache
Set permissions: 700 (or let PHP create it automatically)
```

Or via SSH:
```bash
mkdir /home/username/public_html/api/.cache
chmod 700 /home/username/public_html/api/.cache
```

### **Step 3: Test Coupon Validation** (2 minutes)

Open browser console on your site:
```javascript
fetch('/api/validate_coupon.php', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {'Content-Type': 'application/json'},
  body: JSON.stringify({
    code: 'SAVE20',
    subtotal: 2999
  })
}).then(r => r.json()).then(console.log)
```

**Expected**:
```json
{
  "valid": true,
  "coupon": {
    "code": "SAVE20",
    "name": "Save 20%",
    "type": "percentage",
    "value": 20
  },
  "cached": false
}
```

### **Step 4: Make Test Payment** (5 minutes)

1. Visit your website: https://attral.in
2. Add product to cart
3. Proceed to checkout
4. Apply a coupon (should validate via server now)
5. Complete test payment (Razorpay test mode)
6. Verify redirect to success page

### **Step 5: Verify Everything Works** (2 minutes)

**Check Email**:
- [ ] Customer receives order confirmation email ✅
- [ ] Affiliate receives commission email (if applicable) ✅

**Check Firestore Console**:
- [ ] Order appears in `orders` collection ✅
- [ ] Coupon `usageCount` incremented ✅
- [ ] Coupon `payoutUsage` incremented (if affiliate) ✅

**Check Server Logs** (Hostinger Control Panel):
```
Look for:
✅ "CUSTOMER EMAIL: ✅ Confirmation sent to..."
✅ "COUPON VALIDATION: ✅ Cache hit for..."
✅ "FIRESTORE ORDER: Order created successfully"
```

## 🧪 TESTING SCENARIOS

### **Test 1: Coupon Validation (Server-Side)**

**Test Case**: Valid coupon
```javascript
// Apply coupon 'SAVE20' with ₹2999 order
// Expected: Coupon applied successfully
// Check: Response time < 100ms if cached
```

**Test Case**: Invalid coupon
```javascript
// Apply coupon 'INVALID123'
// Expected: "Invalid coupon code" error
```

**Test Case**: Expired coupon
```javascript
// Apply expired coupon
// Expected: "This coupon has expired" error
```

**Test Case**: Minimum amount not met
```javascript
// Apply coupon requiring ₹5000 with ₹2999 order
// Expected: "Minimum order of ₹5000 required" error
```

---

### **Test 2: Order Creation (Webhook-Only)**

**Test Case**: Complete payment
```
1. Make test payment
2. Check browser console - NO order posting attempts
3. Wait 5 seconds
4. Check Firestore - Order should appear (from webhook)
```

**Expected Logs**:
```
✅ WEBHOOK: Calling firestore_order_manager_rest.php/create
✅ FIRESTORE ORDER: Order created successfully
✅ CUSTOMER EMAIL: Confirmation sent to customer@example.com
❌ NO client-side order posting attempts
```

---

### **Test 3: Customer Email**

**Test Case**: Order completion
```
1. Complete test payment
2. Check customer's email inbox
3. Verify HTML email received
4. Check email contains:
   - Order number (ATRL-XXXX)
   - Total amount
   - Product details
   - Shipping address
   - Tracking link
```

---

### **Test 4: Caching Performance**

**Test Case**: Repeated coupon validation
```
1. Apply coupon 'SAVE20' (first time)
   Response time: ~500-1000ms

2. Remove and re-apply 'SAVE20' (second time)
   Response time: ~10-50ms (90% faster!)
   
3. Check response has "cached": true
```

## 🚨 ROLLBACK PLAN (If Issues Occur)

### **Quick Rollback** (Emergency):

1. **Restore old order.html**:
   ```bash
   # Keep backup before deploying
   cp order.html order.html.backup
   
   # If issues, restore
   cp order.html.backup order.html
   ```

2. **Revert to old coupon loading**:
   - Client-side loading still works (Firebase SDK available)
   - Just restore old applyCoupon() function

3. **Email issues**:
   - Non-blocking - won't affect orders
   - Check Brevo SMTP credentials
   - Review error logs
