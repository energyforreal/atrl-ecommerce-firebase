   - Reason: Was old backup file
   - Impact: None (superseded by admin-dashboard-unified.html)

2. ❌ `api/composer.phar` (3MB)
   - Reason: Composer binary not needed on Hostinger

## 🎯 RECOMMENDED APPROACH

### **For Deployment to Hostinger**:

**Upload ALL files** (including both old and new versions):

```
/api/
├── ✅ New REST API files (will be used)
├── ✅ Old SDK files (won't be used, but available as backup)
├── ✅ vendor/ directory (includes PHPMailer + SDK)
└── ✅ All other production files
```

**Why Keep Old Files for Now**:
1. ✅ Safety net during initial deployment
2. ✅ Easy rollback if issues occur
3. ✅ No harm (webhook uses REST files)
4. ✅ Can delete later after testing

**Cleanup Schedule**:
- **Week 1**: Keep everything (testing period)
- **Week 2**: Delete old SDK files (after verified stable)
- **Week 3**: Clean vendor/ directory (after verified stable)

---

## ✅ WHAT TO DO NOW

### **Option 1: Deploy Everything** (Recommended)

**Action**: Upload entire `/api` directory to Hostinger
- Includes: New REST files ✅
- Includes: Old SDK files ✅ (backup)
- Includes: vendor/ ✅ (all dependencies)

**Benefit**: Safest approach, complete backup available

---

### **Option 2: Deploy Only New Files** (Advanced)

**Action**: Upload only REST API files
- Upload: New REST files only
- Skip: Old SDK files
- Include: vendor/ directory (for PHPMailer)

**Benefit**: Cleaner from start
**Risk**: No backup if issues occur

---

## 📝 SUMMARY

**What Happened**:
- ✅ Created backups of old SDK files
- ✅ Deleted old SDK files
- ✅ User requested restoration
- ✅ Restored all API files from backups
- ✅ Files now back in place

**Current State**:
- ✅ All old SDK files present
- ✅ All new REST API files present
- ✅ Both versions coexist (safe)
- ✅ Backups available in `/api/backups/`

**Files Permanently Gone** (by design):
- ❌ Test HTML files (security risk)
- ❌ Development test scripts
- ❌ Admin bypass script (security risk)
- ❌ composer.phar (not needed)
- ❌ dashboard-original.html (old backup)

---

## 🎯 RECOMMENDATION

**Keep current state for deployment**:
- Both old and new files coexist ✅
- Webhook uses new REST API files ✅
- Old SDK files available as backup ✅
- Can delete old files later after testing ✅

**This is the SAFEST approach for Hostinger deployment!**
