## 🎯 WHAT TO DO NOW

### **Step 1: Upload to Hostinger** (15 minutes)

Via FTP or File Manager:
```
Upload: /api/ directory (all files, ~25MB)
Upload: /order.html (optimized)
```

### **Step 2: Test** (10 minutes)

1. Visit: https://attral.in
2. Apply a coupon (tests server-side validation)
3. Complete a test payment
4. Verify:
   - ✅ Customer receives email
   - ✅ Order in Firestore
   - ✅ Coupon counters increment
   - ✅ No errors in logs

### **Step 3: Monitor** (Week 1)

Check daily:
- Error logs in Hostinger
- Orders in Firestore Console
- Email delivery
- Performance

### **Step 4: Final Cleanup** (Optional - Week 2)

Delete old SDK PHP files:
```
DELETE: api/firestore_order_manager.php
DELETE: api/coupon_tracking_service.php
DELETE: api/order_manager.php
```
