## ✅ What Was Fixed

### 🐛 Bug #1: Wrong API Endpoint
**Found in**: order-success.html line 744
**Problem**: Calling deprecated SDK version that doesn't work
**Fixed**: Changed to REST API version

```javascript
// BEFORE (BROKEN):
fetch(`${apiBaseUrl}/api/firestore_order_manager.php/status?order_id=${orderId}`)

// AFTER (FIXED):
fetch(`${apiBaseUrl}/api/firestore_order_manager_rest.php/status?order_id=${orderId}`)
```

### 🐛 Bug #2: Weak Redirect Logic
**Found in**: order.html line 2221
**Problem**: Single redirect method could fail
**Fixed**: Triple failsafe mechanism

```javascript
// BEFORE (WEAK):
window.location.replace(successUrl);

// AFTER (STRONG):
// 1. Use absolute URL (not relative)
const absoluteSuccessUrl = new URL(successUrl, window.location.origin + ...).href;

// 2. Primary redirect
window.location.replace(absoluteSuccessUrl);

// 3. Backup #1 (100ms later)
setTimeout(() => { window.location.assign(absoluteSuccessUrl); }, 100);

// 4. Backup #2 (500ms later)
setTimeout(() => { window.location.href = absoluteSuccessUrl; }, 500);
```

### 🐛 Bug #3: Cart Link Clickable During Payment
**Found in**: order.html (no protection before)
**Problem**: User could accidentally click cart during payment
**Fixed**: Disable cart link during payment flow

```javascript
// NEW FIX:
cartLink.style.pointerEvents = 'none';  // Can't click
cartLink.style.opacity = '0.5';         // Visual cue
```

## 🎯 Why This Will Fix Your Issue

### Root Cause Identified:

The API endpoint was calling the **deprecated SDK version** (`firestore_order_manager.php`) which:
1. ❌ Requires Composer dependencies (may not work on Hostinger)
2. ❌ May throw errors when SDK not available
3. ❌ Error handling could cause unexpected navigation

### The Solution:

1. ✅ Now calls **PRIMARY REST API** version (`firestore_order_manager_rest.php`)
2. ✅ REST API works on ALL hosting (pure PHP + cURL)
3. ✅ Triple failsafe redirect ensures success
4. ✅ Cart link disabled prevents accidental clicks
5. ✅ Absolute URL prevents path confusion

## 🔍 How to Verify It's Fixed

### After deploying, check browser console:

**You should see**:
```
✅ Payment Success Diagnostics
🔒 Cart link disabled during payment
🔒 Redirect target verified: order-success.html?orderId=XXX

=== ORDER SUCCESS PAGE DIAGNOSTICS ===
📍 Current URL: https://attral.in/order-success.html?orderId=XXX

```

**You should NOT see**:
```
❌ Redirecting to cart.html
❌ Failed to fetch
❌ API call failed
🚨 CRITICAL ERROR: Detected cart.html after payment!
```

   - Stack trace will show what triggered it

2. **The page will auto-fix itself**:
   - Emergency detection kicks in
   - Auto-redirects back to order-success.html
   - Order still completed successfully
