## 🔒 **Critical Bug Fixed: Email Fallback**

### The Problem:
**Before Fix:**
```php
$customerEmail = 'attralsolar@gmail.com'; // fallback ❌
```

If customer email was missing from order data, ALL orders would be sent to `attralsolar@gmail.com`!

### The Solution:
**After Fix:**
```php
if (!isset($input['orderData']['customer']['email'])) {
    throw new Exception('Customer email is required in order data');
}
$customerEmail = $input['orderData']['customer']['email']; ✅
```

### Why This is Correct:
The customer email is stored in **Firestore** when the order is created:

```
Order Flow:
1. Customer places order → Saved to Firestore (includes email)
2. order-success.html → Fetches from Firestore 
3. Order data → Passed to send_email_real.php
4. Email sent → To customer's email from Firestore
```

**If email is missing = Data integrity issue**  
→ Error is thrown (correct behavior)  
→ Admin can investigate and fix the order

## 🔍 **Order-Success.html Email System**

### Current Flow (Working Correctly):

```mermaid
Customer Places Order
    ↓
Firestore (stores order + customer email)
    ↓
order-success.html (fetches order)
    ↓
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Email 1: Order Confirmation        │
│  → send_email_real.php              │
│  → Customer email from Firestore ✅  │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
    ↓
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Email 2: Invoice Email             │
│  → generate_pdf_minimal.php         │
│  → send_email_real.php              │
│  → Includes PDF attachment ✅        │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Files Used:
1. **send_email_real.php** - Sends both emails (FIXED ✅)
2. **generate_pdf_minimal.php** - Generates invoice PDF

### Issues Resolved:
- ✅ Hardcoded email fallback removed
- ✅ Now throws error if customer email missing
- ✅ Ensures data integrity from Firestore

---

## ⚠️ **Remaining Minor Issues (Optional)**

These are **NOT critical** - system works fine as-is:

### 1. Two Separate Emails (MEDIUM priority)
**Current:** Customer receives 2 emails within seconds:
- Email 1: "Order Confirmation"
- Email 2: Invoice email

**Options:**
- A) Keep as-is (works fine)
- B) Combine into one email with invoice attached
- C) Change email subjects to differentiate clearly

**My Recommendation:** Keep as-is for now, monitor customer feedback

---

### 2. Silent Error Handling (LOW priority)
**Current:** Email failures are logged to console but not tracked

**Options:**
- A) Keep as-is (doesn't break user experience)
- B) Add email failure logging to admin dashboard
- C) Add email retry mechanism

**My Recommendation:** Add logging in future update
