# 🚀 QUICK FIX REFERENCE - Redirect Issue

## ⚡ TL;DR

**Problem:** Payment success redirects to cart.html instead of order-success.html  
**Solution:** Clear browser cache + use new code  
**Status:** ✅ FIXED

---

## 🔥 CRITICAL: Clear Cache First!

**90% of issues = browser cache**

### Quick Method:
```
1. Press Ctrl+Shift+N (Incognito mode)
2. Test payment there first
```

### Full Method:
```
1. Press Ctrl+Shift+Delete
2. Select "Cached images and files"
3. Click "Clear data"
4. Press Ctrl+Shift+R (Hard refresh)
```

---

## ✅ Verify Fix Loaded

Open order.html and check console for:

```
🛡️ Original browser methods saved for emergency use  ← MUST SEE THIS!
```

**If you DON'T see this → Still running old code → Clear cache again!**

---

## 🧪 Test Payment

1. **Enable "Preserve log"** in DevTools Console (important!)
2. Complete payment with test card: `4111 1111 1111 1111`
3. Watch for these logs:

```
🔓 Payment flag reset to allow redirect  ← Should see this
✅ Original replace method called         ← Should see this
```

4. **Page should navigate to order-success.html** (NOT cart.html!)
