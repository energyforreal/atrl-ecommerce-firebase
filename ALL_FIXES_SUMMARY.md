location.reload();
```

### Step 2: Clear Browser Cache

**Hard refresh**: `Ctrl + F5`  
**OR use Incognito**: `Ctrl + Shift + N`

### Step 3: Test Each Fix

#### Test #1: Cart Auto-Populate (Should be FIXED)
1. Visit https://attral.in in Incognito mode
2. **Check**: Cart badge should show "0"
3. **Don't click anything**
4. **Verify**: Cart stays at "0"

#### Test #2: Add to Cart (Should work normally)
1. Click "Buy Now" button
2. **Check**: Cart badge increases to "1"
3. **Verify**: Correct product added

## 🔍 Console Checks

After uploading, open browser console and look for:

### On Index.html:
```
✅ Cart count updated to: 0  (not 1!)
```

### During Payment:
```
✅ 🛡️ ULTRA-EARLY: Blocking cart redirects
✅ 🔒 Cart link disabled during payment
✅ 🚀 IMMEDIATE redirect to success page
✅ 🔒 Absolute redirect URL: https://attral.in/order-success.html
```

### On Order-Success.html:
```
✅ 🛡️ ULTRA-EARLY: Order-success protection loading
✅ === ORDER SUCCESS PAGE DIAGNOSTICS ===
✅ 📍 Current URL: https://attral.in/order-success.html?orderId=XXX
✅ 🛒 Cart cleared after successful order confirmation
```

### Should NOT See:
```
❌ ⚠️ Product not found, using first available product for testing
❌ 🚫 BLOCKED redirect to: cart.html
❌ 🚨 CRITICAL ERROR: Detected cart.html after payment!
```

| After Order | Cart still has items |

## 🎯 Root Causes Identified

### 1. Testing Code in Production
**Problem**: Lines 140-144 in app.js had testing fallback  
**Impact**: Auto-added first product when ID didn't match  
**Fix**: Removed testing code completely

### 2. Wrong API Endpoint
**Problem**: order-success.html called deprecated SDK version  
**Impact**: API failures caused unexpected behavior  
**Fix**: Changed to REST API version (PRIMARY system)

### 3. Weak Redirect Logic
**Problem**: Single redirect method could fail  
**Impact**: Redirect to cart.html instead of order-success  
**Fix**: Triple failsafe + absolute URL + cart link protection

## 🚀 Deployment Priority

### High Priority (Upload First):

1. **js/app.js** → Fixes cart auto-populate
2. **order.html** → Fixes redirect issue
3. **order-success.html** → Fixes API + cart clearing

### Medium Priority (Upload After Testing):

4. **clear-cart.html** → Utility tool
5. **redirect-debugger.html** → Debug tool

---

## ✅ Success Checklist

After deploying, verify:

- [ ] Cart shows "0" on fresh page load
- [ ] Cart only increases when clicking "Buy Now"
- [ ] Payment redirects to order-success.html (NOT cart.html)
- [ ] Cart clears after successful order
- [ ] Console shows "ULTRA-EARLY" protection messages
- [ ] No "Product not found, using first available" messages

---

## 📞 If Issues Persist

### For Cart Auto-Populate:
1. Clear localStorage using clear-cart.html
2. Hard refresh browser (Ctrl + F5)
3. Check console for "Product not found, using first available"
4. If you see it → Old app.js cached (clear cache again)

### For Redirect Issue:
1. Use Incognito mode for testing
2. Open redirect-debugger.html in separate window
3. Check console for "ULTRA-EARLY" messages
4. If no "ULTRA-EARLY" → Old files cached (clear cache again)
