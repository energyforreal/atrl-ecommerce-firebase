## 🚨 Issues Fixed

### **Fix #1: Updated Client-Side Endpoint to REST API** ✅

**Problem**: The HTML was calling the OLD SDK-based endpoint instead of the NEW REST API endpoint, which would cause failures on Hostinger.

**File**: `static-site/order.html`

**Changes Made**:

#### Change 1 - Line 2312 (flushPendingOrders function):
**Before**:
```javascript
const res = await fetch(`${apiBaseUrl}/api/firestore_order_manager.php/create`, ...)
```

**After**:
```javascript
const res = await fetch(`${apiBaseUrl}/api/firestore_order_manager_rest.php/create`, ...)
```

#### Change 2 - Line 2329 (postOrderWithRetry function):
**Before**:
```javascript
const res = await fetch(`${apiBaseUrl}/api/firestore_order_manager.php/create`, ...)
```

**After**:
```javascript
const res = await fetch(`${apiBaseUrl}/api/firestore_order_manager_rest.php/create`, ...)
```

**Impact**: 🟢 **CRITICAL** - Client-side order creation now uses the correct REST API endpoint that works on Hostinger shared hosting.

### **Fix #2: Added User ID to Order Data** ✅

**Problem**: Orders weren't being associated with user accounts in Firestore.

**File**: `static-site/order.html`

**Changes Made**:

**Line 1669-1676** (collectOrderData function):

**Added**:
```javascript
// Get Firebase user ID for order association
const fbUser = (window.AttralFirebase && window.AttralFirebase.auth) 
  ? window.AttralFirebase.auth.currentUser 
  : null;

const orderData = {
  // User ID for order association
  user_id: fbUser?.uid || null,
  
  // ... rest of order data
```

**Impact**: 🟢 **MEDIUM** - Orders are now properly associated with authenticated user accounts.

## ✅ Testing Checklist

Before deploying to production, verify:

- [ ] **Test Payment Flow**:
  - Make test payment on order.html
  - Verify client-side order creation succeeds
  - Check browser console for "firestore_order_manager_rest.php" in logs

- [ ] **Test Webhook Flow**:
  - Make test payment
  - Verify webhook receives and processes order
  - Check server logs for successful API call

- [ ] **Test User Association**:
  - Login as authenticated user
  - Make test payment
  - Verify order in Firestore has `uid` field populated

- [ ] **Test Coupon Tracking**:
  - Apply affiliate coupon
  - Complete payment
  - Verify coupon `usageCount` incremented
  - Verify coupon `payoutUsage` incremented by ₹300
  - Check `orders/{orderId}/couponIncrements` for idempotency guard

- [ ] **Test Email Notifications**:
