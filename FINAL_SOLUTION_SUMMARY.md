## 🔧 How It Works

### On EVERY Page Load (Automatic):

```
1. app.js loads
    ↓
2. validateAndCleanCart() runs automatically
    ↓
3. Checks each cart item:
   ✅ Does product exist in catalog?
   ✅ Has valid price (≥ ₹100)?
   ✅ Has required fields?
   ✅ Not test/demo data?
    ↓
4. Removes invalid items silently
    ↓
5. Updates cart count to show correct number
    ↓
6. ✅ Customer sees clean cart
```

### Customer Experience:

- **First visit**: Cart shows "0" ✅
- **After adding product**: Cart shows "1" ✅
- **Refresh page**: Valid item persists, cart shows "1" ✅
- **Old/test data**: Removed automatically, cart shows "0" ✅
- **After checkout**: Cart cleared, shows "0" ✅

**No manual steps. No user intervention. Ever.** 🎯

   - Removes testing fallback code
   - **MOST CRITICAL FILE**

2. ✅ **index.html**

3. ✅ **shop.html**
   - Validates cart before shopping
   - Clean cart for shopping experience

4. ✅ **cart.html**
   - Validates before rendering cart page
   - Shows accurate cart contents

### Additional Files (from earlier fixes):

6. ✅ **order-success.html**
   - API fix + cart clearing after order
