## Please provide answers and I'll give you the exact fix!

Based on your answers, I can determine if:
1. Files weren't uploaded properly
2. Browser cache is serving old files
3. There's a different redirect source
4. The issue is something else entirely

**Most likely cause**: Browser cache serving old files (Solution: Clear cache or use Incognito)
