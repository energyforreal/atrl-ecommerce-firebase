# 🚨 REDIRECT ISSUE TROUBLESHOOTING - IMMEDIATE STEPS

**Status**: Issue persisting even after fixes  
**Priority**: CRITICAL  
**Next Steps**: Follow this guide to diagnose the EXACT cause

---

## 🔧 Step 1: Verify Files Were Actually Uploaded (2 minutes)

### Check in Hostinger File Manager:

1. Navigate to `/public_html/static-site/`
2. Right-click on `order.html` → Properties
3. Check **"Modified Date"** - should be **TODAY** (Oct 10, 2025)
4. Right-click on `order-success.html` → Properties  
5. Check **"Modified Date"** - should be **TODAY** (Oct 10, 2025)

**If dates are OLD** → Files weren't uploaded properly!
- Re-upload both files
- Make sure you upload to correct directory

**If dates are TODAY** → Files are uploaded, proceed to Step 2

---

## 🧹 Step 2: Clear Browser Cache COMPLETELY (3 minutes)

### Chrome:
1. Press `Ctrl + Shift + Delete`
2. Select "All time"
3. Check "Cached images and files"
4. Click "Clear data"

### Firefox:
1. Press `Ctrl + Shift + Delete`
2. Select "Everything"
3. Check "Cache"
4. Click "Clear Now"

### **BETTER**: Use Incognito/Private Mode
- Chrome: `Ctrl + Shift + N`
- Firefox: `Ctrl + Shift + P`
- Test in incognito to ensure no cache interference

---

## 🔍 Step 3: Use Redirect Debugger (5 minutes)

I've created a special debugging page that will show EXACTLY what's redirecting you.

### How to Use:

1. **Upload** `redirect-debugger.html` to your site
2. **Open TWO browser windows side-by-side**:
   - Window 1: https://attral.in/redirect-debugger.html
   - Window 2: https://attral.in/shop.html
3. **In Window 2**: Start your checkout process
4. **Watch Window 1**: It will show EVERY redirect attempt
5. **Complete payment in Window 2**
6. **Check Window 1**: You'll see EXACTLY what redirect happened and WHY

### What to Look For:

**If you see in debugger**:
```
🔄 REDIRECT #1 via replace() to: cart.html
   Called from: [function name and line number]
```

**This will tell us EXACTLY what code is causing the redirect!**

Copy the entire log and send it to me.

---

## 🔍 Step 4: Check Console During Payment (5 minutes)

1. **Open browser console** (Press F12)
2. **Go to Console tab**
3. **Clear console** (click trash icon)
4. **Start checkout process**
5. **Watch console** during payment

### What You Should See (if fix is working):

```
🛡️ ULTRA-EARLY: Blocking cart redirects before any other scripts
✅ ULTRA-EARLY protection active - cart.html redirects will be blocked
🔒 Cart link disabled during payment
🚀 IMMEDIATE redirect to success page
🔒 Absolute redirect URL: https://attral.in/order-success.html?orderId=XXX

[After redirect happens]

🛡️ ULTRA-EARLY: Order-success protection loading...
✅ ULTRA-EARLY: Page location verified - we are on order-success.html
=== ORDER SUCCESS PAGE DIAGNOSTICS ===
📍 Current URL: https://attral.in/order-success.html?orderId=XXX
```

### What You Might See (if issue persists):

```
🚨 ULTRA-EARLY BLOCK: Prevented redirect to cart.html via replace
🚨 Attempted URL: https://attral.in/cart.html
🚨 Stack trace: [This will show WHAT is trying to redirect]
```

**OR**:

```
🚨 ULTRA-EARLY: Detected cart.html - emergency redirect!
```

**Copy your COMPLETE console output** and send it to me!

---

## 🔍 Step 5: Test Specific Scenarios

### Test A: Direct URL Access

Type this in browser: `https://attral.in/order-success.html?orderId=test123`

**What happens?**
- [ ] A) Shows order-success page normally
- [ ] B) Redirects to cart.html immediately
- [ ] C) Shows error message
- [ ] D) Blank page

**If B (redirects to cart)**: There's code ON order-success.html that redirects

### Test B: Check What File Is Loading

1. Open https://attral.in/order-success.html?orderId=test
2. Press F12 → Network tab
3. Look for `order-success.html` in the list
4. Click on it → Preview tab
5. Search for text: "ULTRA-EARLY"

**Do you find "ULTRA-EARLY"?**
- [ ] YES - New file is loading (cache is clear)
- [ ] NO - Old file still cached (CLEAR CACHE AGAIN!)

---

## 🔍 Step 6: Check Network Requests

During payment, check Network tab in browser console:

**After payment success, you should see requests to:**
```
✅ order-success.html?orderId=XXX
✅ api/firestore_order_manager_rest.php/create
✅ api/firestore_order_manager_rest.php/status
```

**You should NOT see:**
```
❌ cart.html
❌ api/firestore_order_manager.php (old SDK version)
```

**If you see cart.html in Network tab:**
- Note the "Initiator" column - it shows what triggered the request
- Share that information with me

## 🚨 Common Causes & Quick Fixes

### Cause #1: Browser Cache (90% of persistent issues)

**Symptoms**:
- Files uploaded to server but issue persists
- Console doesn't show new log messages

**Fix**:
```
1. Press Ctrl + F5 (hard refresh)
2. Or use Incognito mode
3. Or clear cache completely
4. Try different browser
```

### Cause #2: Files Not Uploaded

**Symptoms**:
- Console doesn't show "ULTRA-EARLY" messages
- File modified dates in Hostinger are old

**Fix**:
```
1. Re-download files from Cursor/VS Code
2. Upload via Hostinger File Manager
3. Confirm upload successful
4. Check file sizes match
```

### Cause #3: Wrong Directory

**Symptoms**:
- Files uploaded but nothing changes

**Fix**:
```
Correct paths should be:
/public_html/static-site/order.html
/public_html/static-site/order-success.html

NOT:
/public_html/order.html (wrong!)
/static-site/order.html (wrong!)
```

### Cause #4: Service Worker or CDN Caching

**Symptoms**:
- Cache cleared but old files still loading

**Fix**:
```
1. Open DevTools (F12)
2. Application tab → Service Workers
3. Unregister any service workers
4. Application tab → Clear storage → Clear site data
```

## 💡 Quick Diagnostic Script

**Paste this in browser console RIGHT NOW:**

```javascript
console.clear();
console.log('=== REDIRECT DIAGNOSTIC ===');
console.log('Current URL:', window.location.href);
console.log('Payment Success Flag:', sessionStorage.getItem('__ATTRAL_PAYMENT_SUCCESS'));
console.log('Order ID:', sessionStorage.getItem('__ATTRAL_ORDER_ID'));
console.log('Last Order Data:', sessionStorage.getItem('lastOrderData') ? 'Present' : 'Missing');
console.log('Cart Items:', localStorage.getItem('attral_cart'));
console.log('Attral object exists:', !!window.Attral);
console.log('Firebase exists:', !!window.AttralFirebase);

// Check if new code is loaded
if (document.querySelector('script')) {
  const scripts = Array.from(document.querySelectorAll('script'));
  const inlineScripts = scripts.filter(s => !s.src && s.textContent.includes('ULTRA-EARLY'));
  console.log('ULTRA-EARLY protection found:', inlineScripts.length > 0 ? '✅ YES (new code loaded)' : '❌ NO (old code, cache issue!)');
}

// Test redirect protection
console.log('Testing redirect protection...');
try {
  window.location.replace('cart.html');
  console.log('❌ Redirect to cart.html was NOT blocked!');
} catch (e) {
  console.log('Exception occurred:', e.message);
}

setTimeout(() => {
  console.log('✅ If you see this, redirect was blocked successfully!');
}, 100);
```

**Send me the output from this script!**

## 📊 Data I Need From You

To give you the EXACT fix, please provide:

### 1. Console Output (Most Important!)
- Press F12 during checkout
- Copy EVERYTHING from console (Ctrl+A, Ctrl+C)
- Paste here or send to me

### 2. When Does Redirect Happen?
Tell me AT WHAT EXACT MOMENT the URL changes to cart.html:
- During Razorpay modal?
- After closing Razorpay modal?
- After payment success?
- When landing on order-success?
- A few seconds after landing?

### 3. Network Tab Evidence
- F12 → Network tab
- See what requests are made
- Screenshot or list all requests after payment

### 4. File Upload Confirmation
- Hostinger file manager screenshot showing:
  - order.html modified date
  - order-success.html modified date

---

## 🎯 Next Steps Based on Your Situation

### If you HAVEN'T uploaded the fixed files yet:
→ Upload `order.html` and `order-success.html` from your Cursor workspace  
→ Clear cache  
→ Test again

### If you HAVE uploaded but still having issues:
→ Use Incognito mode (NO cache)  
→ Open redirect-debugger.html in separate window  
→ Run the diagnostic script above  
→ Send me the complete console output

### If files are uploaded AND cache is clear but STILL redirecting:
→ There's a hidden redirect source  
→ The debugger will catch it  
→ Send me the stack trace from console

---

## ⚡ Emergency Bypass (If Nothing Else Works)

If issue persists even after all fixes, **try this nuclear option**:

### Add this to the VERY FIRST line of order.html (before `<!DOCTYPE>`):

```html
<script>
// NUCLEAR OPTION: Force redirect to order-success if payment successful
(function() {
  if (sessionStorage.getItem('__ATTRAL_PAYMENT_SUCCESS') === 'true') {
    const orderId = sessionStorage.getItem('__ATTRAL_ORDER_ID');
    if (orderId && window.location.pathname.includes('order.html')) {
      window.location.replace('order-success.html?orderId=' + orderId);
    }
  }
  
  // Block ANY redirect to cart.html
  const block = (url) => {
    if (String(url).includes('cart.html') && 
        sessionStorage.getItem('__ATTRAL_PAYMENT_SUCCESS') === 'true') {
      const orderId = sessionStorage.getItem('__ATTRAL_ORDER_ID');
      return `order-success.html?orderId=${orderId}`;
    }
    return url;
  };
  
  const origReplace = window.location.replace;
  window.location.replace = function(url) {
    return origReplace.call(this, block(url));
  };
})();
</script>
```

This will FORCE redirect to order-success if payment was successful.
